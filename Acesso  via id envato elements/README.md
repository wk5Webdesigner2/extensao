### What?

Chrome Extension to share your account **without** giving out your **password**.

### Use

1. Ask the recipient for their code (found on the extension menu `RECEIVE ACCOUNT`) 
2. Go to the site from where you want to share the account and click the extension icon.
3. Press `SHARE ACCOUNT` and enter the code with an optional timeout.
4. Press `SHARE` and copy the result.
5. The recipient, still on the `RECEIVE ACCOUNT`, menu pastes the text on the `Share result` textbox and presses the `RECEIVE` button.

### How it works?

The extension uses the Standford Javascript Crypto Lib implementation of EC-ElGamal. It generates a new public-private key combination for each extension upon first use and uses it to encrypt/decrypt the session.

Appart for the keys, it doesn't store anything more than the URL/title of the sessions stored (to show them on the `ACCOUNT HISTORY` menu).

If you want to be extra careful, you can always regenerate your keys on the extension.
